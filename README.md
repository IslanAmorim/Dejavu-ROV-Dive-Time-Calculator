# Dejavu ROV - Dive Time Calculator
The Dejavu ROV - Dive Time Calculator is a specialized tool designed to help offshore teams accurately calculate the duration of underwater operations performed by Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). This tool is essential for tracking the operating time of ROVs and ensuring efficient management of underwater activities. By entering the start and end date/time of a dive, the calculator quickly computes the total dive duration in hours, minutes, and even days.

Features
Dive Duration Calculation: Simply input the start and end date/time, and the tool automatically calculates the total dive duration in hours and minutes.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the interface is simple and intuitive, designed to optimize the time spent on daily offshore operations.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Accessible from any modern browser, this tool works seamlessly on multiple devices, including desktops, laptops, and tablets used in remote work environments.
Interactive Shortcut Icon: In addition to the "Calculate" button, the interface includes an interactive icon resembling a thruster, providing a more engaging user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the application interface.
CSS: Styles the interface, making it visually appealing and organized.
JavaScript: Handles the dive duration calculations based on the input provided.
How to Use
Enter the start date and time of the dive in the first field.
Enter the end date and time in the corresponding field.
Click the "Calculate" button or use the thruster icon to compute the total dive duration.
The tool will display the dive time in days, hours, and minutes.
This application can be used to calculate any duration between two moments, and it is not limited to the context of underwater operations.
