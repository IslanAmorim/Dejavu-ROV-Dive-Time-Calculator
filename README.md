# Dejavu ROV - Dive Time Calculator

The Dejavu ROV - Dive Time Calculator is a specialized tool designed to assist offshore teams in calculating the duration of underwater operations performed by Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). This tool is essential for tracking ROV operating time and ensuring efficient management of underwater activities.

By entering the start and end date/time of a dive, the calculator quickly computes the total dive duration in days, hours, and minutes.

# Features
 🕒 Dive Duration Calculation: Input the start and end date/time, and the tool will automatically calculate the total dive duration in days, hours, and minutes.
 
 💻 User-Friendly Interface: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the interface is simple and intuitive, designed to optimize time during daily offshore operations.

 🌐 Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on any modern browser and is accessible on multiple devices, such as desktops, laptops, and tablets used in remote environments.
 
 🚀 Interactive Shortcut Icon: Includes a visual thruster icon that enhances the user experience, in addition to the standard "Calculate" button.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the application interface.
CSS: Styles the interface to make it visually appealing and organized.
JavaScript: Handles dive duration calculations based on user input.

# How to Use
Enter the start date and time of the dive in the first field.
Enter the end date and time in the corresponding field.
Click the "Calculate" button or use the thruster icon to compute the total dive duration.
The tool will display the dive time in days, hours, and minutes.
This application can be used for any duration calculation between two points in time, not limited to underwater operations.
